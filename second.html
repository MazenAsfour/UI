    <p>“Winning is great, sure, but if you are really going to do
         something in life, the secret is learning how to lose. Nobody goes 
         undefeated all the time. If you can pick up after a crushing defeat,
          and go on to win again, you are going to be a champion someday
          “I Hated every minute of training, but I said, ‘Don’t quit. Suffer now and live the rest of your life as a champion
          “Sports build good habits, confidence, and discipline. They make players into community leaders and teach them how to strive for a goal, handle mistakes, and cherish growth opportunitie
          Age is no barrier. It's a limitation you p
          ut on your mind The pain you feel today will be the S
          TRENGTH you feel tomorrowThe pain you feel today will be 
          the STRENGTH you feelGames may require the individual to carry physical activities or can be done bystaying indoors </p>
